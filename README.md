## 🧠 Philosophy

FreeState Press is a platform for truth without gatekeepers.

We believe in:
- **Decentralized publishing** – so stories can’t be silenced  
- **Zero-budget architecture** – so anyone can build and broadcast  
- **Modular systems** – so tools can be reused across movements  
- **Open-source collaboration** – so knowledge flows freely

This tool is more than a CMS—it’s a statement. If you believe in grassroots media, transparent systems, and publishing that empowers rather than exploits, you’re in the right place.
